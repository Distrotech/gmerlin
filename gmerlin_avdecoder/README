WHAT THIS IS

This is gmerlin_avdecoder, a multimedia decoding library. 
It it primarly a support library for gmerlin, but it can also be 
used as a standalone library for getting sophisticated media file 
decoding support for your application.

It needs gavl, the support library for handling uncompressed audio-
and video data.

In the include directory, you'll find the headers. The public API
is in avdec.h. You might also take a look at the gavl headers for the
definition of the AV-formats and -frames.

The API is damn simple: look at tests/bgavdump.c. This program dumps all
informations, it can find about a media file onto stderr. After that, it
tries to decode one frame of each audio- or video stream.

For further information, you can also consult plugins/i_avdec.c, which is
the actual gmerlin plugin.

REQUIREMENTS:

The configure script autodetects all installed libraries and tell you what's
missing.

FORMATS/CODECS:

Go to the test directory and type ./bgavdump without arguments.
It will print all enabled features in html.
