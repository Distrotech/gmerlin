1. Requirements

First of all: The only required library is gavl, which can be downloaded from
the gmerlin website. All other libraries are OPTIONAL, i.e. the configure script
will search for them and use them, if they are found. The more libraries you have,
the more files you can play, e.g. if you really don't want to decode AAC streams,
you can skip the installation of faad2 and everything will be fine for you.

The website (http://gmerlin.sf.net/avdec.html) lists all packages, which can be
used by gmerlin_avdecoder. At the very end, the configure script prints out a
summary of the packages it found.

If you want to install the gmerlin plugins, you also need to install gmerlin
before compiling gmerlin_avdecoder.

If you installed a library but it wasn't found by the configure script,
the error is in 99% of the cases one of the following:

- A binary package (e.g. rpm) was installed but not the development package
 (e.g. for libfoo-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm you also need libfoo-devel-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm)

- The path where the libraries got installed (usually /usr/local/bin for source
  packages) is missing in the file /etc/ld.so.conf. This is the case e.g. on
  Fedora Core 3. Add the path there, run /sbin/ldconfig as root and everything
  should work.

- After installation of the library, /sbin/ldconfig wasn't called

- The package wasn't found, because the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not
  properly set. Typing

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

  before calling configure helps in most cases.

If all these tips don't help, attach the file config.log to an email and send it to
gmerlin-general@lists.sourceforge.net.

2. Compilation

Nothing special here. It's the usual procedure:

./configure
make
su
<type root password>
make install

The configure script supports some command line options, type

./configure --help

to see them.

3. Binary codecs

You can install some binary dlls. They can be obtained from the MPlayer
codec page (http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/). Get the file
all-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 where YYYYMMDD is some date string (get the latest one).
Unpack them in a directory of your choice. Then you must tell gmerlin_avdecoder
where to find the libraries. In gmerlin, you can do this via the plugin dialogs
for the Avdecoder plugin. An alternative is to set some environment variables.

For each dll, gmerlin_avdecoder cannot find, it will print instructions on the
console.
