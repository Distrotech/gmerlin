This package contains some encoder plugins for gmerlin.
If you install it, gmerlin-transcoder will be able to
encode more file formats.

I utilizes mostly the existing encoder APIs for the
supported formats. A small amount of common code is in the
lib directory with the headers in include.

Please consult the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
