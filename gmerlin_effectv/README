This package contains most effects from EffecTV (http://effectc.sourceforge.net)
ported to gmerlin. Missing Effects are mostly the ones, which do
things, which cannot be done within a generic filter API.

This is, what *was* changed:

- Moved all global variables to context structures (everything
  is multiple-instance save now)

- Made generic wrapper functions so the EffecTV functions are
  called within the gmerlin filter API.

- Transformed most interactivly changable parameters to gmerlin
  parameters. Some additional parameters where introduced.

- The only suppoorted colormodel is GAVL_BGR_32

This is, what *could* be changed:

- Make more things user settable

- Some filters just copy frames around. They
  could be implemented (for all pixelformats) using standard
  gavl functions

- Some other filters just work on whole 32 bit pixels. They
  could run directly in GAVL_RGB_32, GAVL_RGBA_32 and GAVL_YUVA_32
