** How to compile on MacOS X **
*******************************
In a shell, type the following (without quotes): "./autogen.sh && make"
The iTunes plugin and the standalone app should be built in the mac folder.
"make install" is NOT recommended (the build results would only work for you)
Distributors only : The mac Makefile also contains a special "package" target to build the distribution disk image.
If you need only the library to be built use "./configure  --disable-mac-frontends"
