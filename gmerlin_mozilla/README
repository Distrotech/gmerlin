This is a mozilla based browser plugin, which plays audio and video
streams (and local files) within firefox (and probably other gecko-based
browsers too). It's in an experimental stage, but already quite functional.
Please note the following:

- It supports *only* linux and gtk-2. On other OSes, it won't compile,
  when loaded from a non-gtk2 browser, it won't initialize.

- It's scriptable through the npruntime API, but not many functions are
  implemented yet.

- Installation happens the usual autotools way. This won't however put the
  module into a mozilla directory. Instead, each user can en-disable the
  plugin with the scripts 'gmerlin-mozilla-enable' and 'gmerlin-mozilla-disable'
