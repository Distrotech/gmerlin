This is gavl, a library for handling uncompressed video-
and (soon) audio data.

It is developed as an integral part of the gmerlin sourcetree,
but the neccesary stuff was added to make it usable as a 
standalone library.

See the header file include/gavl.h and the sample files
src/colorspace_test.c and src/colorspace_time.c for
information and how to use this thing.

By default, gavl is compiled as a static library.

For testing the library, the src directory contains
some test programs.

colorspace_test:
Makes your current directory full of pngs, one test file
for each colorspace and one for each conversion.
Ideally, all these pictures should look the same.

colorspace_time:
Makes all defined conversions 20 times and prints, how long
it needed. Good for making C <-> MMX speed comparisons.

Every programmer, who agrees to this kind of API is welcome to
integrate gavl into his/her project so we can save some
energy while writing/searching the best and fastest
conversion routines.
