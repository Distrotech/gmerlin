GAVL</h1>
GAVL stands for <b>G</b>merlin <b>A</b>udio <b>V</b>ideo <b>L</b>ibrary.
It is an attempt to write an optimized, general purpose conversion library
for uncompressed audio- and video data. The goal is to have a central location,
where everyone can put his/her routines.
<p>It currently supports only colorspace conversions and the allocation
of video frames with pointers aligned at proper boundaries. In future versions,
video scaling as well as audio resampling might also appear here.
<p>It has the following features:
<ul>
<li>
Extremely simple C API, which hides the internals of the conversion but
gives a reasonable level of user control</li>

<li>
Complete set of colorspace conversions, every colorspace can be converted
to every other.</li>

<li>
The use of function tables makes it possible to have several versions (C,
MMX etc.) of a routine. Selection of the routines is based on&nbsp; compile
time configuration, runtime detection and user settable flags.</li>

<li>
Heavy use of C macros creates 100s of conversion functions using only few,
easily optimziable lines of code.</li>

<li>
Integrated testsuite automatically creates timing comparisons for the different
versions of all conversion routines</li>

<li>
You need nothing but gcc to compile this. All other library dependencies
were removed (only for the testsuite, you need the png library)</li>

<li>
This library released is under the GPL license and cannot used by commercial
applications, unfortunately :-)</li>
</ul>
Planned features are:
<ul>
<li>
High quality mode with slower routines, which are fully standards compilant
and suitable for high end applications</li>

<li>
Maybe a few more colorspaces</li>

<li>
Audio conversion routines: Mixing, resampling</li>

<li>
Video scaling and deinterlacing</li>

<li>
.....</li>
</ul>
This library is a side project of the gmerlin project. It replaces gmerlins
own colorspace converter (which was too bad, really...). It is planned
also to port gmerlins audio conversion engine (which isn't too bad) to
gavl.
