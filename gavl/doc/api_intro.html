GAVL API Documentation</h1>

<h2>
1. Intoduction</h2>

<h3>
1.1 Usage</h3>
Gavl can be used in two flavours: As a standalone library, which can be
linked with executables for dynamic modules, and as a convenience library,
which will statically linked with your application. In the last case, you
should include gavl into the source distribution of your package. Switching
between both modes is done by the --enable-library configure option. If
you use this option, the library (libgavl.so.*) will be installed in &lt;prefix>/lib,
and the header file gavl.h in &lt;prefix>/include. If you ommit the option,
nothing will be installed.
<p>You can integrate gavl in your autoconf/automake/libtool build tree.
For this, you need to call the gavl configure script by adding it to AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS
in the top level configure.ac file. All files, which include gavl headers,
need to be compiled with -I&lt;gavl_directory>/include, where &lt;gavl_directory>
is the location of gavl relative to the sourcefile. To link your exectuable,
add &lt;gavl_cirectory>/gavl/libgavl.la to the *_LDADD variables.
<p>All exported functions are defined in the header file gavl.h, so every
sourcefile, which makes use of GAVL sould contain the line
<pre>#include &lt;gavl.h></pre>

<h3>
1.2 Using CPU specific features</h3>
For the conversion mode, the following constants are defined in gavl.h:
<p><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;0)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_C_HQ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;1)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_MMX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;2)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_MMXEXT&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;3)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_SSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;4)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_SSE2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;5)</tt>
<br><tt>#define GAVL_ACCEL_3DNOW&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&lt;&lt;6)</tt>
<p>All routines are available in a Standard C version. C-High Quality functions
aren't available for all routines, but they are always there, no matter
on what platform gavl runs. Processor specific routines are selected acccording
to runtime detection and compile time configuration. If you pass invalid
flags here, they will silently be ignored. Normally, you will always pass
GAVL_ACCEL_C and either GAVL_ACCEL_C_HQ (for highest quality) or the supported
processor specific flags for higher speed requirements.
<p>To get the supported accellerations (runtime detection) use:
<p><tt>int gavl_accel_supported();</tt>
<p>Note, that GAVL_ACCEL_C and GAVL_ACCEL_C_HQ are never returned by this
function, so you must OR these flags manually if you want to use them.
<p>The audio- and videoconversions have an option structure, with an integer
accel_flags. Set the flag to an ORed combination of the above flags to
select the desired converison mode.
