This is gmerlin, a set of multimedia libraries bundled with an application suite.

For documentation, check the file doc/usersguide.html. This file won't get installed
as the final format of gmerlin documentation isn't decided yet.

This package contains the core libraries, some plugins and most applications.
For installation instructions and troubleshooting tips, read the file 
INSTALL. For instructions how to install the whole suite of gmerlin packages
including the depdencies, check the file doc/usersguide.html.

The following applications are included in this package:

- Player: Just type gmerlin to start this. It's a media player with a mediatree
  where you can store your media collection in virtual directories (albums).
  In the tree window and in the album windows, right-click and context sensitive menus
  will tell you your options. There are also tooltips helping you through the software.
  To toggle between fullscreen and windowed playback, press the TAB key while the mouse
  is in the video window.

- Transcoder: Type gmerlin_transcoder to start this. It works very simple:
  First, add tracks to the tasklist. Then, edit options (Metadata, encoder settings...)
  for each track. The task list can then be saved for later use. After all tracks are
  configured, start transcoding.

- Alsamixer: Type gmerlin_alsamixer to start this. It's a mixer application which handles
  100s of mixer controls without needing too much desktop space. Right click onto the
  controls, and you can reorder them.
  You can also move important controls to separate windows and iconify the main window after.
  Supported are an arbitrary number of soundcards with an arbitrary number of controls each.

- Camelot: A small and simple webcam application. It lets you save webcam images either manually
  or automatically.

- Plugin configurator: If you want to write a command line application, which uses gmerlin plugins,
  you might want to avoid translating 100s of plugin options into command line options.
  This can be done by typing gmerlin_plugincfg. It lets you configure all plugin options and
  save them at a location, where other applications can find them. One application, which uses
  this, is gmerlin_visualizer, which also comes as a separate package.
