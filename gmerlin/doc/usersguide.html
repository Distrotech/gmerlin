<h1>1 Basics</h1>
<a name="introduction">
<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>

This manual should help you to get familiar with gmerlin software. The gmerlin
software is quite modular, because it consists of multiple packages, most of which
can be used independently. In this document, it is assumed, that you have
all packages installed (See Installation below).

<a name="installation">
<h3>1.2 Installation</h3>

<a name="requirements">
<h4>1.2.1 Requirements</h4>

<table border="1">

Required libraries can be installed from source for from binary packages.
In the latter case, you MUST install the development packages (e.g.
libfoo-devel-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm) also. This is what you need:
<p>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org" target="_top">Alsa </a></td><td>It's the recommended audio architecture</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html" target="_top">esound</a></td><td>Only needed if
neither Alsa nor OSS work for you.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">flac</a></td>
<td>For decoding flac files (Optional).</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.gtk.org/" target="_top">gtk-2.4.x</a></td><td>This is needed for compiling
the GUI applications. Without it you'll get just the core library, which won't be of much use.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.ijg.org/" target="_top">libjpeg</a></td><td>For reading and writing single JPEG images
(strongly recommended)</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html" target="_top">libpng</a></td><td>For reading and writing single PNG images (strongly recommended).
Also for decoding png encoded Quicktime and AVI files</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/" target="_top">libtiff</a></td><td> For reading and
writing single TIFF images (Optional)</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/" target="_top">libxml</a></td><td>Required. All kinds of configuration files
as well as the media tree are xml based.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.vorbis.com" target="_top">vorbis</a></td><td>Needed for Vorbis files
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

From now on, there are 2 ways to proceed:
<ul>
<li>You can download and install the gmerlin-dependencies package, unpack it and install it using the
instructions in the README file. A full dependencies install will provide you with the complete features,
but some packages you already have might be installed a second time.
Everything, however, gets into /opt/gmerlin, so there will be no conflicts.
<li>To have more control over the process, download and install the libraries below
</ul>

<table border="1">
<tr><td><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/">libcdio </a></td><td>Neccessary for the VCD and
Audio CD plugins. You need the latest CVS version or the one in the gmerlin-dependencies package.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://musicbrainz.org/products/client/index.html">libmusicbrainz </a></td>
<td>Needed for getting Audio CD metadata using <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">musicbrainz</a></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.audiocoding.com" target="_top">faad2</a></td><td>Needed for MPEG-4 audio
support (mp4, aac files). The latest official faad-2.0 won't
play some streams. The current CVS version or the rpms from
<a href="http://freshrpms.net" target="_top">freshrpms</a> should be ok.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org" target="_top">FFmpeg</a></td><td>Many other codecs,
strongly recommended. You should get a sufficiently new version from
<a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/download.php" target="_top">ffmpeg CVS</a>
and use --enable-shared when calling configure. If you are a beginner and are scared by things
like CVS, go to <a href="http://www.acarlab.com/software/ffmpeg.html" target="_top">aCarLab (India)
</a> for a simpler to install ffmpeg package.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.mp3dev.org/" target="_top">lame</a></td><td>For encoding mp3s.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://mad.sourceforge.net" target="_top">libmad</a></td><td>For playing MPEG-1/2 audio (e.g.
for mp3)</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://libquicktime.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">libquicktime</a></td>
    <td>Optional, for the libquicktime based encoding and decoding plugins. Mostly necessary if you
    want to encode video. For decoding Quicktime, gmerlin_avdecoder is a lot better.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/" target="_top">libsamplerate</a></td><td>Required.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">libmpeg2</a></td><td>For decoding MPEG-1/2 Video (like .mpg files)</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://liba52.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">liba52</a></td><td>For playing AC3 (aka DVD audio) streams
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="http://www.musepack.net/" target="_top">libmusepack</a></td><td> For playing musepack files.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="compilation">
<h4>1.2.2 Compilation and installation</h4>

If you downloaded a release, make sure, that you have the latest version of all packages.
Alternatively, you can download the latest gmerlin-all-in-one package. It contains all
source packages together with optional scripts to build and install them. Check the README file.<p>

We always try to be compatible ther GNU build system. This means, thas all gmerlin
packages are compiled using the usual <code>./configure; make; su; make install</code> prodecure.
Type <code>./configure --help</code> to see the supported options.<p>
The order is the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=50349" target="_top">
<b>gavl</b></a>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=14511" target="_top"><b>gmerlin</b></a>

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=124659" target="_top"><b>gmerlin_avdecoder</b></a>
<li><b>gmerlin-encoders</b>
</ul>

<a name="binary_codecs">
<h4>1.2.3 Binary codecs</h4>
These must be downloaded from the
<a href="http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/" target="_top">MPlayer codec page</a>. 
The savest way is to download the file all-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2, where YYYYMMDD is some date.
Unpack the .tar.bz2 and move the included files to a directory of your choice.<p>
To tell gmerlin about the DLLs, set the environment variables GMERLIN_AVDEC_CODEC_PATH_XANIM,
GMERLIN_AVDEC_CODEC_PATH_REAL and GMERLIN_AVDEC_CODEC_PATH_WIN32 to the directory. Alternativey,
you can configure the paths in the config dialog of the avdecoder plugin. This must, however, be done
for each application separately.<p>
To check your setup, start gmerlin from a terminal and play e.g. an mp3 file. Whenever the gmerlin_avdecoder
plugin is initialized, it prints messages for each missing binary codec.

<a name="general_usage">
<h1>2 General usage information</h1>
<a name="configuration_data">
<h2>2.1 Configuration data</h2>
They are saved in the directory ~/.gmerlin, which has subdirectories for all applications. The directory
"generic" stores common configuration data for applications, which have no config dialog. Plugins used by these
programs can be configured with the <b>gmerlin_plugincfg</b> application.
If a program misbehaves, especially after a version upgrade, delete the file
<code>~/.gmerlin/application_dir/config.xml</code>, where <code>application_dir</code> corresponds to the
application. Normally, this shouldn't be necessary<p>
All applications except <b>gmerlin_visualizer</b> have their own configuration data. This means, that changes
made to plugin configurations are not shared between these applications.

Most applications have a configuration dialog, which lets you change some global settings.
Then, there is a plugin dialog, which lets you select and configure plugins.

It might be a bit tricky to find out if a special option can be set via the
the plugin dialog or via the global config dialog. The general rule is:
All features, which are supported independently from any plugins, are configured
in the global dialog. You can expect them to be present on every gmerlin installation of the
same version. The plugin dialog changes depending on what plugins are installed. That's the reason,
why they are separated.


<a name="gui">
<h2>2.2 GUI</h2>

We try to make this as consistent as possible across the applications. In many windows, you'll see context
sensitive menus when you right click somewhere. Furthermore, tooltips are enabled in all programs by
default. You can, however, switch them off if they bother you.
Many dialogs behave exactly the same in all applications, because they share a lot of code.<p>
The configuration dialogs for global and plugin related settings are strictly separated.
There is one dialog, which lets you configure global settings. These are always there, no matter what
plugins are installed. Then, there is a plugin dialog, which is built dynamically based on the available plugins.
It lets you change plugins, which are not autodetected (e.g. the soundcard plugin). There is always a config button,
which lets you configure the plugin.

<a name="remote">
<h2>2.3 Remote control</h2>
The player and the transcoder are remotely controllable by the commandline programs <b>gmerlin_remote</b> and 
<b>gmerlin_transcoder_remote</b> respectively. Call them with -help as argument to see the options. 
These plugins listen at ports starting with 10101 by default. You can change these via environment variables:<p>

    <table border="1">
<tr><td><code>GMERLIN_PLAYER_REMOTE_PORT</code></td><td> Port for the player remote, default 10101.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GMERLIN_TRANSCODER_REMOTE_PORT</code></td><td> Port for the transcoder remote, default 10102.</td></tr>
</table><p>

By default, remote enabled applications will listen on the localhost (127.0.0.1) only. If you want to
control your gmerlin applications from other computers too, enable it in their config dialogs.<p>

Finally there is a script <code>gmerlin_launcher</code>. It can be used as a Mime handler by filenamagers
and webbrowsers. If <code>gmerlin_launcher</code> is called with a file or URL as argument, it will launch
a gmerlin player if neccesary, add the location to the Incoming album and start playing it.

<a name="applications">
<h1>3 Applications</h1>

<a name="player">
<h2>3.1 Player</h2>
Type <code>gmerlin</code> with any number of files or URLs to start this. If you omit any commandline
arguments, the GUI will come.

<a name="media_tree">
<h3>3.1.1 Media tree</h3>
The media tree can be used to store and organize your media collection. It consists of virtual folders
called <b>albums</b>. You can create albums, subalbums and move stuff between them like you
want. The media files always stay at the same place in the filesystem. The albums can be either in
own windows (Windowed mode) or as tabs in the tree window (Tabbed mode).
The tree- and album windows remember their screen positions.<p>
You can create your own albums by right clicking onto the parent album in the tree and select Album->New.
Whenever you doubleclick a track, it will be played immediately.
In addition to the regular albums, there are a number of special albums:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Incoming: </b>It's the destination for tracks, which come from the comandline or from
	the remote.
	<li><b>Favourites: </b>Each regular album has a Favourites button, which lets you copy the selected
	tracks to the Favourites.
	<li><b>Plugin and device-albums: </b>Each plugin, which handles e.g. cdrom drives, will create a
	plugin album. The available devices are then autoscanned and added as subalbums. Tracks from
	decvice albums can never be mixed with files or URLs in one album.
    </ul>
Adding tracks to the media tree can happen in multiple ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Drag Files or URLs from filenanagers or webbrowsers into an album forlder in the tree or into
	an album directly.
      <li>Use the buttons in the album toolbar, or the right click menu
      <li>Via the right-click menu (Album->New from directory...) of the tree window, you can import
	entire directory trees. Subdirectories will be added as subalbums if you want.
      <li>Configure <code>gmerlin_launcher</code> as a MIME Handler for the supported filetypes in your desktop
          environment. <code>gmerlin_launcher</code> will then send all doubleclicked files into the
          <b>Incoming</b>-album.
    </ul>
Drag and Drop is supported:
    <ul>
      <li>Inside the tree window to move albums (inclusive subalbums) around
      <li>From one regular album to another
      <li>Inside all albums to sort the tracks
      <li>From an album window into the tree window to transfer tracks to another album
    </ul>
When dragging albums, they are always moved. When dragging tracks, the default action is move.
If you hold the Ctrl-Key before you start dragging, the tracks will be copied.<p>

If you close the currently played album during playback, the player will stop after the current track is
finished. You can then select another album by doubleclicking a track inside it.

<a name="main_window">
<h3>3.1.2 The main window</h3>
It's a usual player window, with self explanatory buttons. The menu button will show the main menu of the
player. It lets you configure plugins and other global settings, show other windows, launch other
applications and so on.

<a name="video_window">
<h3>3.1.3 The video window</h3>
This comes only when gmerlin has to show some video. While the video plays, you can
press the TAB key to toggle between windowd and fullscreen mode.

<a name="transcoder">
<h2>3.2 Transcoder</h2>
Type <code>gmerlin_transcoder</code> to start this. It has only one window, which contains the tasklist.
A tasklist stores ALL information necessary to transcode the track. This includes codec settings,
bitrates etc. You can load and save tasklists, the current tasklist is remembered.
Using the right-click-menu, you can change the encoding plugins for tracks, with the configure
button at the lower toolbar, you can configure each track.

New tracks can be added:
    <ul>
      <li>by dragging files or URLs from filenanagers or webbrowsers into the tasklist
      <li>by using the buttons in lower toolbar or the right click menu
      <li>From the player by right clicking into an album end select Selected->Transcode
      <li>By dragging Tracks from a gmerlin album into the tasklist
    </ul>

The upper toolbar controls global things. Here you can select and configure plugins as defaults
for newly added tracks. Moreover, you can load/save tasklists,
start/stop transcoding, set some global options and track defauls and quit the program.

<a name="alsamixer">
<h2>3.3 Alsamixer</h2>
This was written because available programs often don't support the full range of soundcard
settings. By right clicking on a control, you can:
<ul>
<li>Move controls inside the window
<li>Move controls to own windows. To move them back to main window, simply close the
control-windows.
<li>Pop up a dialog, where you can select which controls will be shown at all
</ul>
All window configurations and coordinates are remembered. The actual mixer settings are NOT
remembered, since this is done globally by the startup scripts.

<a name="get_involved">
<h1>4 Get involved</h1>
Contribution to gmerlin can happen at several skill levels:
<ul>
<li>Report bugs and installation problems, tell about features you'd like to see.
<li>Tell us about files, which cannot be played. An URL and some infos (e.g. <i>MPlayer plays it fine</i>)
    can help a lot.
<li>Make skins. In /usr/local/gmerlin/skins/Default/skin.xml, you'll find an example skin description file.
<li>Assembler gurus can write more speed optimized routines for gavl
<li>Mathematics gurus can write more accurate routines for the higher quality levels of gavl.
</ul>
