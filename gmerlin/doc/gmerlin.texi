This manual should help you to get familiar with gmerlin software. The
gmerlin software is quite modular, because it consists of multiple
packages, most of which can be used independently. In this document,
it is assumed, that you have all packages installed (See Installation below).

@section Requirements

For compiling x264, you need @uref{http://nasm.sourceforge.net/, nasm}
(@uref{http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/, yasm} on x86_64).
They are included in
most distributions. Required libraries can be installed from source or from
binary packages. In the latter case, you must install the development
packages (e.g. libfoo-devel-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm) also. This is what you need:

@table @emph

@item @uref{http://www.alsa-project.org/, Alsa}
It's the recommended audio architecture

@item @uref{http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html, esound}
Only needed if neither Alsa nor OSS work for you.

@item @uref{http://flac.sourceforge.net/, flac}
For en-/decoding flac files (optional).

@item @uref{http://www.gtk.org/, gtk-2.4.x}
This is needed for compiling the GUI applications. Without it you'll
get just the core library, which won't be of much use.

@item @uref{http://www.ijg.org/, libjpeg}
For reading and writing single JPEG images (strongly recommended)

@item @uref{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html, libpng}
For reading and writing single PNG images (strongly recommended).
Also for decoding png encoded Quicktime and AVI files

@item @uref{http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/, libtiff}
For reading and writing single TIFF images (Optional)

@item @uref{http://www.xmlsoft.org/, libxml}
Required. All kinds of configuration files as well as the media
tree are xml based.

@item @uref{http://www.vorbis.com/, vorbis}
Needed for en-/decoding Vorbis files. Also required for the
theora encoding.

@item @uref{http://musicbrainz.org/products/client/index.html, libmusicbrainz}
Needed for getting Audio CD metadata using
@uref{http://musicbrainz.org/, musicbrainz}

@item @uref{http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/, libcddb}
Needed for getting Audio CD metadata from CDDB servers

@item Headers for libXv and libXinerama
These are usually shipped with X11 but some distributions pack the header
files separately (e.g. libxv-dev, libxinerama-dev). libXv is needed for
hardware accelerated video playback, libXinerama adds support for
multi-screen configurations.

@item @uref{http://www.samba.org/, libsmbclient}
For loading smb:// URLs (optional).

@item @uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/libvisual, libvisual}
For using libvisual plugins (optional).

@item @uref{http://www.ladspa.org, Ladspa plugins}
Optional for audio filters/effects. Good experiences were made with
the plugin packages @uref{http://www.ladspa.org/cmt/,cmt},
@uref{http://plugin.org.uk, swh-plugins} and
@uref{http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net, tap-plugins}. Gmerlin looks for them
at runtime, so you can install them at any time.

@end table

From now on, there are 2 ways to proceed:
@itemize @bullet
@item You can download the
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=151779, gmerlin-dependencies}
package, unpack it and install it using the instructions in the README file.
A full dependencies install will provide you with the complete codec support,
but some packages you already have might be installed a second time.
Everything, however, gets into /opt/gmerlin, so there will be no conflicts.

@item To have more control over the process, download and install the
libraries listed below manually. 
@end itemize

@table @emph
@item @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/, libcdio}
Neccessary for the VCD, Audio CD and DVD plugins.

@item @uref{http://www.audiocoding.com/, faad2}
Needed for MPEG-4 audio support (mp4, aac files).

@item @uref{http://www.audiocoding.com/, faac}
Needed for MPEG-4 audio encoding (.aac files) and for AAC encoding via
libquicktime.

@item @uref{http://www.ffmpeg.org/, FFmpeg}
Many codecs, strongly recommended. You should get a sufficiently new
version from @uref{http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/download.html, ffmpeg SVN}
and use --enable-shared when calling configure. Another option is the
version in the
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=151779, gmerlin-dependencies} package.

@item @uref{http://www.mp3dev.org/, lame}
For encoding mp3 files and AVIs with mp3 audio streams with libquicktime.

@item @uref{http://mad.sourceforge.net/, mad}
For playing MPEG-1/2 audio (e.g. mp3)

@item @uref{http://freshmeat.net/redir/libdvdread/17926/url_homepage/downloads.shtml, libdvdread}
For playing DVDs. Gmerlins method of accessing DVD drives doesn't
differ much from others. Thus, DVD playback howtos found in the web
apply for gmerlin as well.

@item @uref{http://developers.videolan.org/x264.html, x264}
For H.264 encoding with libquicktime.

@item @uref{http://developers.videolan.org/libdca.html, libdca}
For decoding DTS streams.

@item @uref{http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/, libmpeg2}
For decoding MPEG-1/2 Video (like .mpg files and DVD video)

@item @uref{http://liba52.sourceforge.net/, liba52}
For playing AC3 (aka DVD audio) streams.

@item @uref{http://www.musepack.net/, libmpcdec}
For playing musepack files (optional).

@item @uref{http://www.theora.org/, theora}
For en-/decoding theora video (optional).
 
@item @uref{http://www.speex.org/, speex}
For en-/decoding Speex streams (optional).

@item @uref{http://libquicktime.sourceforge.net/, libquicktime}
Optional, for the libquicktime based encoding and decoding plugins.
Mostly necessary if you want to encode video. For decoding Quicktime,
gmerlin_avdecoder is a lot better.

@item @uref{http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/, mjpegtools}
Optional for en-/decoding yuv4mpeg streams and for encoding high
quality MPEG video using mpeg2enc and friends.

@end table

@node Compilation and installation
@section Compilation and installation

If you downloaded a release, make sure, that you have the latest
version of all packages. Alternatively, you can download the latest
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=151778, gmerlin-all-in-one}
package. It contains all source packages together
with optional scripts to build and install them. Check the included
README file.

We always try to be compatible ther GNU build system. This means, that
all gmerlin packages are compiled using the usual
@code{./configure; make; su; make install} prodecure. Type
@code{./configure --help} to see the supported options.

The order is the following:

@itemize
@item @uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=50349, gavl}
@item @uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=14511, gmerlin}

@item @uref{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19684&package_id=124661, gmerlin-visualizer}
@end itemize

@node Binary codecs
@section Binary codecs

These must be downloaded from the @uref{http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/, MPlayer codec page}. Download the file
essential-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2, where YYYYMMDD is some date. Unpack the
.tar.bz2 and move the included files to /usr/lib/codecs. At this
location, the DLLs will also be found by other players.

@node Configuration data
@section Configuration data

They are saved in the directory @code{~/.gmerlin}, which has subdirectories
for all applications. The directory "generic" stores common configuration
data for applications, which have no config dialog. Plugins used by these
programs can be configured with the gmerlin_plugincfg application. If a
program misbehaves, especially after a version upgrade, delete the file
@code{~/.gmerlin/application_dir/config.xml}, where @code{application_dir}
corresponds to the application. Normally, this shouldn't be necessary.

@end menu

@node gui_intro
@subsection Introduction

We try to make this as consistent as possible across the applications.
In many windows, you'll see context sensitive menus when you right
click somewhere. Furthermore, tooltips are enabled in all programs by
default. You can, however, switch them off if they bother you. 

@node gui_statdyn
@subsection Static and dynamic parameters

All GUI applications have their own configuration data.
This means, that plugin configurations are not shared between
these applications.

There is a strict separation between static and plugin dependent
configurations. 

Most applications have one or more config dialogs
@ifhtml
(
@image{../img/config_16}
)
@end ifhtml
which let you change settings either for several subsystems of the
application or for plugins, depending on the context.
To change the plugins themselves, there are separate plugin dialogs
@ifhtml
(
@image{../img/plugin_16}
)
@end ifhtml
which let you select and configure plugins.

It might be a bit tricky to find out if a special option can be set
via the the plugin dialog or via
the global config dialog. The general rule is: All features, which are
supported by the core architecture, are configured in some global
dialog. You can expect them to be present on every gmerlin installation
of the same version. The plugin options vary depending on what plugins
are installed (that's the reason, why they are separated).

@node gui_op
@subsection Selecting output plugins

@node gui_i
@subsection Configuring input plugins 

@ifhtml
@image{../img/gui_i}
@end ifhtml

This dialog lets you control, how input plugins (or image reader plugins)
are loaded. The widgets on the right are valid for the plugin, which is selected
on the left. You have the following options:

@table @b
@item Parameters
@ifhtml
@image{../img/config_16}
@end ifhtml
Lets you set parameters of the plugin. These will be valid when an instance of
the plugin is opened the next time. If you configure hardware plugins in the player,
you must close and reopen all device albums for the changes to become effective.
For plugins, which have no options, this button is disabled.
@item Info
@ifhtml
@image{../img/info_16}
@end ifhtml
Pops up a window showing much of the information, which is known to the plugin
registry.
@item Priority
This lets you change the priority of the plugin, if multiple plugins are
available for a gml. The value can be between 1 and 10. Usually, the default
priorities are ok. But for image files, the priorities of the ``Image stills input plugin'' and the ``Image video input plugin'' decide, whether images are displayed
as a slideshow or a video.
@item Protocols
Lets you configure the supported network protocols. The protocols should rarely
be changed and changes are overwritten by a new install of the plugin. For plugins,
which don't support network streams, the protocols cannot be changed.
@item Extensions
Lets you configure the file extensions, which are associated with the plugin.
If you change the extensions, they are overwritten by a new install of the plugin.
That's a good reason to report missing file extensions to the developers.
@end table

@node gui_f
@subsection Configuring filters

@ifhtml
@image{../img/gui_f}
@end ifhtml

This dialog lets you build a filter chain to apply additional changes to the
A/V data. The GUI player will apply most changes during playback (reinitializing the
playback pipelines if necessary), the transcoder can change filter chains only per
track. The filters are processed in top-to-bottom order.

You have the following buttons:

@table @b
@item Add filter
@ifhtml
@image{../img/add_16}
@end ifhtml
Pops up a dialog, which will let you add new filters to the chain.
Filter are always added to the end of the chain.
@item Remove filter
@ifhtml
@image{../img/trash_16}
@end ifhtml
Deletes the currently selected filter
@item Configure filter
@ifhtml
@image{../img/config_16}
@end ifhtml
Set parameters of the currently selected filter 
@item Move to top
@ifhtml
@image{../img/top_16}
@end ifhtml
Move filter to the top (= the beginning) of the chain
@item Move up
@ifhtml
@image{../img/up_16}
@end ifhtml
Move filter up by one
@item Move down
@ifhtml
@image{../img/down_16}
@end ifhtml
Move filter down by one
@item Move to top
@ifhtml
@image{../img/bottom_16}
@end ifhtml
Move filter to the bottom (= the end) of the chain
@end table

@b{Note for the player}

Even though filter parameters are changed on the fly,
pressing ``cancel'', without pressing ``apply'' before will
revert all changes you made.

@node gui_log
@subsection Log messages
Messages from pretty much everywhere in the applications are sent through the
logging mechanism, and finally show up in the log window. It's the first place to
look, if something does not work as expected (e.g. an URL does not load).
There are 4 different types of messages, @b{error}, @b{warning}, @b{info} and
@b{debug}. In the configuration for the log window, you can select, which message
you want to see and the colors of the messages.
@node gui_tips
@subsection Tips

@itemize
@item Many buttons, which are assosiated with a list, are disabled unless you select an item in the list
@item Doubleclicking onto the background of a slider (@strong{not} the slider itself) resets it to the
      factory default
@end itemize

@node gml
@section GML Syntax

GMLs (Gmerlin media locations) are pretty much similar to URLs or
MRLs with the difference, that device plugins support passing the device.
A gml can be:

@table @bullet
@item A regular filename
Optionally preceeded with ``file://''. This means, that @b{/files/music.mp3} is the same as
@b{file:///files/music.mp3}.
@item A dash ``-'' or the string ``stdin://'' for reading from stdin
@item Any valid network URL
Examples: @b{http://webstream.example.com:8080}, @b{ftp://user:pass@@ftp.example.com/music.mp3}
@item A "hardare protocol" followed by the device like @b{cda:///dev/hdc}.
Known hardware protocols are @b{cda} (Audio CD), @b{vcd}, @b{dvd} and
@b{dvb}. The supported protocols may vary according to your installation.
@end table


@node Setting parameters from the commandline
@section Setting parameters from the commandline

Gmerlin configuration handling provides the same features for both GUI
applications and commandline programs. The natural result is, that the
commandline syntax is a bit more complicated, since parameters can be
nested.

In General options have the form

@code{'parameter1=value1:parameter2=value2...'}

The quotes are necessary, if the string contains characters, which
have a special meaning for the shell.

The syntax of values depends on the type:
@table @strong
@item Boolean
Value can be either 0 or 1.
@item Integer values
An integer number.
@item Float values
A floating point (i.e. fractional) number.
@item Strings
A string. Colons ':' should be escaped with '\'.
@item Time
Time is in the format @code{@{[[HH:]MM:]SS@}} while the seconds can be
fractional. Hours and Minutes are optional, thus any format of
@code{@{5.5@}}, @code{@{0:05.5@}} or @code{@{0:00:05.5}@} is valid for a time
of 5.5 seconds. Writing @code{0} instead of @code{00} is also ok.
@item Enumeration with suboptions
Value is in the form
@code{string[@{subparameter1=subvalue1:subparameter2=subvalue2...@}]}.
The subparameters are optional. E.g. if the option is for selecting a
plugin, setting string to @code{foo} will select the plugin @code{foo} and
pass the subparameters (if avaliable) to the @code{foo} plugin.
@item List or chain with suboptions
This is like enumeration with suboptions with the difference, that
you can concatenate multiple options together with colons (:) and
must enclose everything with braces. For example:

@code{@{opt1@{param1=value1@}:opt2@{param2=value2@}@}}

If you use @code{-help}, you'll also see supported ranges for
numeric types, or supported options for strings (if available).

@node Media tree
@subsection Media tree

The media tree can be used to store and organize your media collection.
It consists of virtual folders called @emph{albums}. You can create albums,
subalbums and move stuff between them like you want. The media files
always stay at the same place in the filesystem. The albums can be either
in own windows (Windowed mode) or as tabs in the tree window (tabbed mode).
The tree- and album windows remember their screen positions.

You can create your own albums by right clicking onto the parent album in
the tree and select Album->New. Whenever you doubleclick a track, it will
be played immediately. In addition to the regular albums, there are a
number of special albums:

@itemize @bullet
@item @emph{Incoming:}
@ifhtml
@image{../img/incoming_closed_16}
@end ifhtml

It's the destination for tracks, which come from
the comandline or from the remote.

@item @emph{Favourites:}
@ifhtml
@image{../img/favourites_closed_16}
@end ifhtml

Each regular album has a Favourites button
@ifhtml
@image{../img/favourites_16}
@end ifhtml
, which
lets you copy the selected tracks to the favourites. It's useful for
quickly making a selection of tracks from multiple different albums.

@item @emph{Plugin and device albums:}
@ifhtml
@image{../img/hardware_16}
@end ifhtml

Each plugin, which handles devices like removable disc drives
@ifhtml
@image{../img/drive_running_16}
@end ifhtml
or tuners
@ifhtml
@image{../img/tuner_16}
@end ifhtml
will create a plugin album. The available devices are
then autoscanned and added as subalbums. Device albums are a bit limited:
You can delete or reorder tracks, but you cannot move tracks from/to other
albums.

@end itemize

Adding tracks to the media tree can happen in multiple ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item Drag Files or URLs from filenanagers or webbrowsers into an album
folder in the tree or into an album directly.
@item Use the buttons
@ifhtml
@image{../img/folder_open_16}
@end ifhtml
@ifhtml
@image{../img/earth_16}
@end ifhtml
in the album toolbar, or the right click menu
@item Via the right-click menu (Album->New from directory...) of the tree
window, you can import entire directory trees. Subdirectories will be added
as subalbums if you want.
@item Configure @code{gmerlin_launcher} as a MIME Handler for the supported
filetypes in your desktop environment. @code{gmerlin_launcher} will then
send all doubleclicked files into the @emph{Incoming}-album. 
@end itemize

Drag and Drop is supported:
@itemize @bullet
@item Inside the tree window to move albums (inclusive subalbums) around
@item From one regular album to another. By default, tracks are moved.
  Press the @key{CTRL}-key before dragging, and the tracks will be copied.
@item Inside all albums to sort the tracks
@item From an album window into the tree window to transfer tracks to
  another album

@end itemize

If you close the currently played album during playback, the player will
stop after the current track is finished. You can then select another
album by doubleclicking a track inside it.

Inside the album, you have the following shortcuts:

GUI player. It can be used as a helper application if webbrowsers
or filenmanagers or for all kinds of remote control methods (including
keyboard- or infrared-daemons), which can execute arbitrary shell
commands.

@subsection Usage

Type @code{gmerlin_transcoder} to start this. It has only one window,
which contains the tasklist. A tasklist stores ALL information necessary
to transcode the track. This includes codec settings, bitrates etc. You can
load and save tasklists, the current tasklist is remembered.

New tracks can be added in various ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item By dragging files or URLs from filenanagers or webbrowsers into the tasklist
@item By using the buttons in lower toolbar or the right click menu
@item From the player by right clicking into an album end select Selected->Transcode
@item By dragging tracks from a gmerlin album into the tasklist
@end itemize

The @emph{upper toolbar} controls global things. Here you can select and configure
plugins as defaults for newly added tracks. Moreover, you can load/save
tasklists, start/stop transcoding, set some global options and track defaults and
quit the program.

The @emph{lower toolbar} provides operations, which are applied for the
currently selected tracks. Some of them require just one track to be selected.

For configuring tracks, first, set the encoding plugins with Selected->Change
encoders. Then configure the encoders with Selected->Configure. The task list
has also a right-click-menu with more stuff.

@node Alsamixer
@section Alsamixer

This is a mixer program, which is still convenient, if you have multiple soundcards
with 100s of options each. It provides widgets for almost all soundcard parameters,
which are supported by alsa.

By right clicking on a control, you can:

@itemize @bullet
@item Move controls inside the window
@item Move controls to own windows. To move them back to main window,
  simply close the control-windows.
@item Pop up a dialog, where you can select which controls will be shown at all
@end itemize

All window configurations and coordinates are remembered. The actual mixer
settings are @emph{not} remembered, since this is done globally by the
Alsa startup scripts.

@node Visualizer
@section Visualizer

Gmerlin visualizer opens your soundard for recording and displays a visualization
in a window. It supports fullscreen and mouse- and keyboard interaction with visuals
for visualization plugins, which support this.

@node Installation questions
@section Installation questions

@strong{Q:} @emph{Why do I have to install so many packages to get all features?}

@strong{A:} Because having one huge package is not good for people, who want to use
only one small subset of the included libraries or applications. To make installation
a bit easier, there are the gmerlin-dependencies and gmerlin-all-in-one packages.

@strong{Q:} @emph{How do I enable Ladspa plugins?}

@strong{A:} Gmerlin looks for Ladspa plugins in @code{/usr/lib/ladspa} and
@code{/usr/local/lib/ladspa} by default. Additional paths can be set with the
@code{LADSPA_PATH} enviromnent variable.

@strong{Q:} @emph{Which Ladspa plugins work with gmerlin?}

@strong{A:} All plugins, which have either 1 or 2 input and output ports. The numbers
of input- and output ports must be equal.

@strong{Q:} How do I enable DVB?

@strong{A:} Gmerlin looks for DVB devices in /dev/dvb. Then, you must pass gmerlin
  a channel configuration file created with the @uref{http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/LinuxTV_dvb-apps,dvb-apps}
  tools. Check the documentation coming with dvb-apps for how to create channel files. Gmerlin looks for channel maps
  in the directories @code{$HOME/.szap}, @code{$HOME/.tzap}, @code{$HOME/.czap},
  @code{$HOME/.azap}, @code{$HOME/.mplayer} and @code{$HOME/.xine}. The first time, you load the DVB plugin,
  and each time you changed your channel map, the plugin will tune to each transponder and get the full
  information about the programs (the information provided by dvp-apps is not sufficient). This can take some time.
  
@node Usage questions
@section Usage questions

@strong{Q:} @emph{Ok, I compiled gmerlin and started the player, now how do I  play a file?}

@strong{A:} The best way is to first create an album (right click onto the
root item in the tree). Then open the album and, in the album view,
use one of the buttons at the bottom to open a file or URL. Or drag the
file from a filemanager into an album.

@strong{Q:} @emph{Can I play a VCD image from harddisk before burning?}

@strong{A:} Yes. If you use vcdimager, you have 2 files: a .bin file and a .cue
   file. If you load the .cue file with the avdecoder plugin, you'll be
   able to play the VCD image.

@strong{Q:} @emph{Can I play a DVD image from harddisk or from a mounted DVD drive?}

@strong{A:} Yes, in the dvd directory, go to the subdirectory @code{video_ts} and load the
   file @code{video_ts.ifo}.
   
@strong{Q:} @emph{Can I play an audio CD image from harddisk before burning?}

@strong{A:} Not yet.

@strong{Q:} @emph{How can I make gmerlin the default audio CD player on my Desktop environment?}

@strong{A:} First, find out how to configure the default audio CD player on your system.
   Usually, you can set a command, which is executed, when a new audio cd is inserted.
   Assuming your cdrom device is @code{/dev/hdd}, the command for opening and playing
   an audio cd is:

   @code{gmerlin_remote -launch -openplay cda:///dev/hdd}

   If you just want ot open the CD (without starting playback), use:

   @code{gmerlin_remote -launch -open cda:///dev/hdd}
   
@strong{Q:} @emph{How can I make gmerlin the default DVD player on my Desktop environment?}

@strong{A:} Same as for audio CDs, but replace @code{cda://} with @code{dvd://}.

@strong{Q:} @emph{How can I configure gmerlin as a Mime handler for media files on my Desktop environment?}

@strong{A:} Find out how to set up mime handlers (e.g. right click onto a file and select ``Open with...'').
   Then, enter the command @code{gmerlin_launcher}.
   
@strong{Q:} @emph{How can I map multimedia keys on my keyboard to gmerlin functions?}

@strong{A:} You need some way to configure custom shell commands for multimedia keys. Check the
documentation of your Desktop system. To remote control gmerlin, use the commandline program
@code{gmerlin_remote}. Type @code{gmerlin_remote -help} for supported options and commands.
