INTRODUCTION

This is Gmerlin Visualizer, a small application, which does only one thing:
Run xmms viszalization plugins without having to run xmms.

It uses gmerlins audio recording architecture, so it can grab audio data
from many sources including other applications (e.g. via the Alsa loopback 
mechanism) or the line in connector of your soundcard. Use the gmerlin
plugin configurator to set up the desired recording mode.

It is known, that Gmerlin Visualizer doesn't work with all plugins, some
crash  when enabled, some crash when disabled and some crash when reenabled.
But it works nice with many good plugins.

INSTALLATION

You need the following development packages (with header files!) before
compiling :

- gmerlin-lib
- gtk-1.2.x
- xmms

For running the application, you also need at least one of gmerlins
soundcard packages (oss, esd, alsa or whatever).

Then do the usual

./configure
make
su
<type root password>
make install

the configure script will detect the directory, where you installed your
xmms visualization plugins. This means, if you unistall xmms from /usr and
resintall it in /usr/local, you have to recompile Gmerlin Visualizer.

USAGE

Type gmerlin_visualizer and a smalll window comes up, which lets you
en- and disable each installed visualization plugin individiually.
